            <p class="para">Nellore is a city located on the banks of Penna River,in Nellore district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.It serves as the headquarters of the district, as well as Nellore mandal and Nellore revenue division.It is the fourth most populous city in the state.The Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh is the largest acid lime-producing center in the country, with Gudur being the biggest market. Surveys of this area revealed that total losses were 3.89–4.08 percent from farm to retail level. These relatively low losses were attributed to green and hard fruit, which can withstand rough handling. While harvesting, some small-sized immature fruits also fall down; such fruits are included in culled fruits. Thorn injury and splitting/cracking are other important causes of losses. Splitting occurs after an abrupt increase in soil moisture. Surveys indicated that fruits damaged by mite attack were negligible: 0.08–0.1 percent (Table 3.5). At the wholesale level, the losses were observed to be due to bruising, rotting, and rupture. </p>
